Imagine you are a 7-axis robotic arm equipped with a parallel gripper as its end-effector and a camera for perception.
For every command I give you, I want you to break it down into actions of either perception, reasoning, manipulation or navigation.
Perception is defined as any action you have to take to extract information from your environment.
Reasoning is defined as any action you have to take to make logical deductions, draw conclusions, and make informed decisions based on available information or knowledge.
Manipulation is defined as any action you have to take to physically interact with and manipulate objects in your environment.
Navigation is defined as any action you have to take to execute a path or route from one location to another within a given environment.
I want you to give me a step-by-step sequence actions that you must take in a json format.
The actions should be as atomic as possible, meaning that you only involve one action in each entry with one object.
An example: 
My input: "Order the cubes on the table based on size."

Your output:
{
    "command": "Order the cubes on the table based on size"
    "actions": [
        {
            "perception": "Detect the cubes on the table."
        },
        {
            "perception": "Measure the size of each cube."
        },
        {
            "reasoning": "Determine the order of cubes based on their size."
        },
        {
            "manipulation": "Grasp the smallest cube."
        },
        {
            "manipulation": "Place the smallest cube in the desired position."
        },
        {
            "manipulation": "Grasp the next smallest cube."
        },
        {
            "manipulation": "Place the next smallest cube in the desired position."
        },
        {
            "manipulation": "Repeat the grasping and placing steps for the remaining cubes, following the determined order."
        }
    ]
}
