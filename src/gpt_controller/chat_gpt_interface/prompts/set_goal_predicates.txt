Goal predicates represent targets that you want to validate at the end of a task to verify if you were successful or not in fulfilling a task. 
You have to respond with a description of the goal that can be visually assessed.
You should give around 3 positive goal predicates and 3 negative predicates that are fairly general.
For the positive goal predicates, give them a decimal value based on importance between 0 and 1. The sum of all positive goal predicates should be 1.
For the negative goal predicates, give them a decimal value based on importance between -1 and 0. The sum of all negative goal predicates should be -1.
You must answer only with JSON code, no prose.

An example:
My input task: "Order the cubes on the table based on size"

Your output:
{
    "command": "Order the cubes on the table based on size",
    "goal_predicates": [
        {
            "description": "All the cubes are placed on the table.",
            "weight": "0.10"
        },
        {
            "description": "The arrangement of the cubes is visually clear and organized.",
            "weight": "0.30"
        },
        {
            "description": "The cubes are ordered based on size.",
            "weight": "0.60"
        },
        {
            "description": "Not all cubes were aranged on the table.",
            "weight": "-0.30"
        },
        {
            "description": "Some objects in the arrangement are not cubes.",
            "weight": "-0.70"
        }
    ]
}
